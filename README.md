Note: This is work in progress. Code is not final and PCB is not tested. Target date when this will be ready is around mid January 2021.

# Battery powered temperature logger
Circuit and PCB are available at https://easyeda.com/funnybrum/battery-powered-temperature-logger.

## Building the project

The project uses a common set of tools that are availabe in another repo - https://github.com/funnybrum/esp8266-base. Clone the esp8266-base repo in the lib folder:

```
cd lib
git clone git@github.com:funnybrum/esp8266-base.git
```

Actually the changes should become part of the esp8266-base project. This introduces only the required files to enable the development of the POC. Once done all details (base) brum@brum-XPS-13-9370:/brum/dev/HMv2$ 

# Future improvements
* Blue LED output from the microcontroller
* MCP73831 stat output connected to the microcontroller
